    "Known Elements and Energies:\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary, elements, is given where known elements (like Cu, Fe, Zn) are associated with their respective energies. This aids in identifying and labeling peaks in the spectrum.\n",
    "Reading Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The read_data function reads a CSV file and extracts the energy and counts columns.\n",
    "Peak Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two methods implemented for peak detection:\n",
    "Threshold Method: This is a simple method where a peak is identified if its count is greater than a user-defined threshold and is also greater than its neighboring values. This method may not be highly accurate for complex data.\n",
    "Scipy Method: This utilizes the find_peaks function from the scipy.signal module, which is more sophisticated and can accurately detect peaks using various properties, including height.\n",
    "Quantification:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each detected peak, the quantify_peaks function computes the area by summing the counts in a range around the peak. The range is hardcoded as 5 units before and after the peak. This quantified data helps in understanding the prominence or intensity of each peak.\n",
    "Annotating Peaks:\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotate_peaks function labels the detected peaks with the closest known element from the elements dictionary.\n",
    "Data Adjustments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can introduce noise, adjust peak heights, and smooth the data:\n",
    "Noise: Random noise is added based on a normal distribution.\n",
    "Peak Height: The counts are multiplied by a user-defined factor to simulate a change in peak height.\n",
    "Smoothing: The Savitzky-Golay filter, a polynomial smoothing method, is applied to the data. This can help in reducing noise and making peaks more distinguishable.\n",
    "Background Subtraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "To differentiate true peaks from the background noise or continuous contributions, a background subtraction method is implemented.\n",
    "The function subtract_background fits a polynomial (cubic by default) to the regions of the spectrum assumed to be just background. Once the background is estimated, it's subtracted from the original data to emphasize the peaks.\n",
    "Interactive Widgets:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provides an interactive GUI using ipywidgets. Users can upload data, select peak detection methods, set thresholds, introduce noise, adjust peak heights, smooth data, and visualize results in real-time.\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is used for plotting. The plots help visualize the original data, detected peaks, background subtraction, and quantified peaks."
